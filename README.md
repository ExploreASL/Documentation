### Build Process

To build a new version of the ExploreASL documentation site you have to install both Python and PIP on your current system.
Then you have to install the following libraries:

```
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
```

Download the GitHub repository and test the mkdocs system by typing in the following command in your command window:

```
run mkdocs serve
```

If you updated markdown files, you can generate a new site with the following command:

```
run mkdocs build
```
