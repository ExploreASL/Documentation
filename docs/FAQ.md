> I am new to ASL-MRI and I do not know how to import and process data. Where should I start?

We recommend to start with our **ASL-BIDS** and **Basics** tutorials. For more details on the BIDS data format in general, we recommend to read the [BIDS documentation](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

> I would like to use ExploreASL, but I do not have a Matlab license. Can you help me?

ExploreASL is based on a variety of toolboxes that were written in Matlab. We have an ExploreASL GUI, a compiled version, and a docker integration though, so that everyone can use ExploreASL without Matlab license fees - see the [Installation Tutorial](../Tutorials-Installation/).

> Doing **x** worked just fine in ExploreASL version **a** but doesn't work in version **b**. What should I do now?

We recommend to check out the **Change Log** tab. Changes between different versions of ExploreASL are documented there.

> I developed a nice method/idea on how to process a specific kind of dataset. How can I support ExploreASL by adding my code to it?

We always look forward to new methods and tools to improve ExploreASL. Please feel free to contact the developer team, we normally answer to e-mails pretty quickly.

> I was reprocessing a dataset with ExploreASL version **b** which was previously processes with version **a**. Now I get weird warnings. What should I do now?

Parameters and settings can change between different versions of ExploreASL. We try to keep it to a minimum, but sometimes there is no way around it. Check the **dataPar** template and the **Change Log** tab, to find out if some of your x-structure variables have changed.

> I have a question that is not in the list above. What should I do now?

Please feel free to contact the developer team, we normally answer to e-mails pretty quickly. There are also bi-weekly meetings of the developer team, so if you feel like you could contribute to our open-source project or you would like to ask a question in person, feel free to ask for an invite.
