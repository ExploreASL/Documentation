#### Function
```matlab
function xASL_im_CreateASLDeformationField(x, bOverwrite, EstimatedResolution, PathLowResNIfTI)
```

#### Description
This function smooths a transformation flow field to a lower resolution. Usually, we use a high resolution anatomical image (e.g. 3D T1w) to obtain the flowfields from native space to standard space, and apply these to the lower resolution ASL images. Because of the resolution differences, the flowfields need to be downsampled/smoothed, to avoid deformation effects that are crispier than the functional image that is investigated. This function performs the following steps:

1. Obtain resolutions
2. Fill NaNs at edges y_T1.nii flowfield to prevent interpolation artifact
3. Smooth flowfield
4. Fill NaNs at edges y_ASL.nii

Note that if the resolution of ASL is not significantly (i.e. >0.5 mm in any dimension) lower than T1w, the y_T1.nii is copied to y_ASL.nii

```matlab
function xASL_im_CreatePseudoCBF(x, spatialCoV)
```

#### Description
This function creates a pseudo-CBF image from mean CBF template, arterial transit time (ATT) bias field & vascular artifacts, weighted through spatial CoV.
The first part of this code puts templates in the native space and creates a pseudoCBF image from a downsampled pGM & pWM tissue (PseudoTissue). The latter is used for registration but also as reference for the template registration, to speed this up.
The second part of this code computes a pseudoCBF image based on the pseudoTissue & the CBF templates of CBF, ATT biasfield and vascular peaks, based on spatial CoV.
This submodule performs the following steps:

1. Create the pseudoTissue CBF reference image, if it doesnt exist already
2. Create the native space copies of ASL templates, if they dont exist already
3. Spatial CoV input argument check
4. Load native space copies of templates
5. Create pseudoTissue from segmentations, mix this with the mean CBF template depending on spatial CoV

This function uses exact same ASL matrix changes that occurred due to registration to MNI, motion correction and registration to T1.

1.    Create slice gradient in same space as input file
2.    Reslice slice gradient to MNI (using existing ASL matrix changes from e.g. registration to MNI, motion correction, registration to GM)
3.    Creating average slice gradient

### xASL_im_DecomposeAffineTransformation.m

#### Function
```matlab
function [M, P] = xASL_im_DecomposeAffineTransformation(Mtransformation)
```

#### Description
This function splits a transformation matrix into individual components, which can be useful to guide the SPM reslicing.
The components are the same as in spm_(i)matrix.m, except for the shearing: these are included in the rotations, and the 90 degree rotations, these are separated.

Reason for the separation of the 90 degree rotations, is that these indicate if orientations (transversal, coronal & sagittal) have been switched in the NIfTI.

This can be useful to correct for any erroneous 90degree rotations from registration, or to put two images in the same orientation order or voxelsize without applying their subtle realignment (e.g. for manipulating registration references).

----
### xASL_im_M0ErodeSmoothExtrapolate.m

#### Function
```matlab
function [ImOut] = xASL_im_M0ErodeSmoothExtrapolate(ImIn, x)
```

#### Description
This function erodes, smooths & extrapolates M0 in standard space.
It assumes that the M0 image is in standard space & that the GM & WM probability maps are aligned. Here, we mask the M0, to remove high CSF signal and low extracranial signal, enabling us to smooth the image without inserting wrong signal. See also the ExploreASL manuscript for a more extensive explanation. This function performs the following steps:

* Mask 1) Load segmentations, create structural mask
* Mask 2) Create intensity-based mask to remove extracranial signal
* Mask 3) Erode the combined masks
* Mask 4) Determine any odd borders
* 5) Smoothing
* 6) Extrapolating only
* 7) Scale back to the GM M0
* 8) Print visual QC figure

A visual QC figure is created, showing the M0 image processing steps for a single transversal slice (slice 53 in 1.5 mm MNI standard space).

OutputFile = fullfile(x.D.M0regASLdir, ['M0_im_proc_' x.P.SubjectID '.jpg']);
The original M0 image (a) is masked with a (pGM+pWM)>50% mask (b) eroded with a two-voxel sphere to limit the influence of the ventricular and extracranial signal (c) and thresholded to exclude significantly high (i.e. median + 3 \* mean absolute deviation (MAD)) border region values (d) This masked M0 image is smoothed with a 16x16x16 mm full- width-half-maximum Gaussian filter (Mutsaerts et al., 2018) (e) after which the signal at the border is smoothly extrapolated until the full image is filled (f).
             

----
### xASL_im_MaskNegativeVascularSignal.m

#### Function
```matlab
function [NegativeMask, TreatedCBF] = xASL_im_MaskNegativeVascularSignal(x, IsSpace)
```

#### Description
This function segments clusters with significant negative ASL signal. This can be tricky as there is also the negative tail of Gaussian noise from the ASL subtraction. The image feature we use here, is that negative vascular signal will be a relatively large region with significant median negative value, whereas noise will be regions with relatively small negative signal.
Negative signal from wrong background suppression timing (e.g. in the first slice with 2D EPI) can be masked out with this as well.
The procedure works as follows:

1. Obtain mask of negative voxels within pGM>0.5 mask
2. Obtain distribution of subzero clusters
3. Define the negative threshold
4. Create mask by thresholding whole image

Note that the definition of the threshold is obtained within the GM only, but that this threshold is applied to the full image.

----
### xASL_im_MaskPeakVascularSignal.m

#### Function
```matlab
function [MaskIM, TreatedCBF] = xASL_im_MaskPeakVascularSignal(PathCBF, Path_M0, bClip, ClipThresholdValue, CompressionRate)
```

#### Description
This function searches for an acceptable high threshold as definition of high intra-vascular ASL signal.
It also allows to compress the values here (when
bClip==true). Compression retains some variability, but limits their outlying influence on statistics. The procedure works as follows:

1. Segment GM on ASL image at 80th percentile of CBF image distribution
2. For PWI & CBF images, select voxels higher than median + ClipThresholdValue MAD Vascular artifacts will have a high intensity in both images, whereas errors by division by M0 will only have a high intensity on the M0 image, and high values due to a biasfield will only be noticeable on the PWI image
3. Combine the two created masks
4. Obtain average clipping value from selected voxels from the combined masks
5. Apply compression if requested. If not, output image will have NaNs for intra-vascular voxels.

Note that the definition of the threshold is obtained within the GM only, but that this threshold is applied to the full image to also remove extracranial extreme values

### xASL_im_PreSmooth.m

#### Function
```matlab
function pathOut = xASL_im_PreSmooth(pathRef, pathSrc, pathSmo, resRef, resSrc, srcAffinePath, bInvAffine)

#### Description
It assumes that the FWHM is equal to voxel size, unless the real resolution is given. Then takes into account the voxel sizes and orientation difference between the volumes, but performs the smoothing according to the given real resolution (it is possible to supply the resolution for just one image) - this should be helpful primarily when the. It creates a Gaussian covariance matrix for the reference, transforms it according to the difference between the two images a produces the Gaussian covariance matrix of the pre-smoothing in the source space. Then it performs the smoothing.
The following steps are performed:

1. Obtain the voxel size
2. Skip this function if reference resolution is equal to, or lower than source resolution
3. Deal with affine transformation
4. Obtain the transformation matrix from the Reference to the Source space
5. Apply the smoothing filter on the source image(s)

### xASL_init_DefineStudyData.m

#### Function
```matlab
function [x] = xASL_init_DefineStudyData(x)
```

#### Description
This initialization wrapper initializes the parameters for this pipeline run, i.e. subjects, sessions (runs), timepoints (visits), exclusions, sites, cohorts etc.

These parameters should be provided in .mat files in the root analysis folder. Each .mat file should contain a single type of metadata, and the filename should equal the variable name. Metadata content should be a cell array with subjects as first column and metadata as last column. Sessions (runs) can be included as second column.

Metadata can be in any string or numerical format.

participants.tsv is now added per BIDS. It looks for metadata in participants.tsv first, before going through the mat-files.

This function iterates through the following steps for each variable:

1. Admin (what nOptions do we call ordinal, convert subject numeric to string, remove white spaces from data)
2. Get unique list of data options & check for missing data
3. Deal with data format (correct NaNs, deal with numeric vs strings)

* FBER_WMref_Ratio - Foreground to Background Energy Ratio (FBER), i.e. the variance of voxels within the brain (in pGM+pWM mask) divided by the variance of voxels in the WM reference region. Higher = better.
* EFC_bits         - Shannon Entropy Focus Criterion (EFC), i.e. the entropy of voxel intensities proportional to the maximum possibly entropy for a similarly sized image. Indicates ghosting and head motion-induced blurring. Lower = better.
* Mean_AI_Perc     - mean relative voxel-wise absolute Asymmetry Index (AI) within the brain (pGM+pWM mask) (%)

### xASL_qc_WADQCDC.m

#### Function
```matlab
function xASL_qc_WADQCDC(x, iSubject, ScanType)
```

#### Description
This QC function runs WAD-QC specific Python script to zip QC information & incorporate this into a DICOM field for analysis on the WAD-QC server, by the following:

1. Define QCDC script: this is the Python script written by Gaspare, edited by Joost Kuijer & copied to the EPAD CustomScripts folder of ExploreASL
2. Python installation location is checked, with several known locations, for several servers. If we cannot find it, the QCDC is not ran
3. Previous QCDC results are cleaned. QCDC stores all its results in a separate folder (Something like 2 layers up from the current folder, here referred to as QCDCDir = [x.D.ROOT 'qcdc_output']) from these result files, only the filled DICOM file is interesting, all the rest are copies of the QC results that we embedded into the DICOM
4. Run QCDC (if Python installation detected). The following files need to be set as executable:
    * ('QCDC', 'src', 'qc_data_collector.py')
    * ('QCDC', 'src', 'bash', 'create_dcm_only_wadqc.sh')
    * ('QCDC', 'src', 'bash', 'sendwadqc.sh')
5. Clean up new QCDC results (as above) & move the filled. DICOM to ['qcdc_' DummyFile] within the current ScanType folder.
6. Sending the DICOM to the WAD-QC server using storescu

1. include information about where to find the dummy DICOM (i.e. placeholder DICOM)
2. For ExploreASL' QC fields (as passed through in x.Output), here we note all these QC fields for each ScanType, as the x.Output should have been collected equally in the QC file 'QC_collection_SubjectName.json' by function xASL_qc_CollectParameters
3. Subfunction xASL_qc_WADQC_images - Includes visual standard space QC images, by searching them on prescribed paths within the Population folder (where currently all derivatives reside)
4. Insert the PDF report; this PDF report is subject-specific, not scan-specific. For completeness it is added to each QCDC descriptor
5. Add WAD-QC server details (i.e. IP address etc)
6. Save the Descriptor JSON file.

----
### xASL_spm_affine.m

#### Function
```matlab
function xASL_spm_affine(srcPath, refPath, fwhmSrc, fwhmRef, otherList, bDCT)
```

#### Description
This SPM wrapper runs SPM's old normalize-estimate function, which calculates the affine transformation (i.e. linear + zooming and shearing) that is required to align the source image with the reference image. By default it does not estimate the low-degree Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to have a simple affine transformation  but this can be enabled in this wrapper. Also note that this affine transformation uses a correlation cost function, hence it requires the source and reference images to have similar contrasts and resolution - or provide the resolution estimates so the smoothing can be done.
This function does not change the orientation header by default, but it allows to change those of others through the otherList. If bDCT is used or no otherList given, it stores its estimated affine transformation as orientation difference matrix in a file with the same path but \_sn.mat extension. For the provided smoothing FWHM, note that smoothnesses combine with Pythagoras' rule (i.e. square summing).

----
### xASL_spm_BiasfieldCorrection.m

5. Rename temporary SPM file into output file

----
### xASL_spm_coreg.m

#### Function
```matlab

```

#### Description
This SPM wrapper runs SPMs coregister-estimate function, which calculates the 6 parameter rigid-body transformation (a.k.a. linear) that is required to align the source image with the reference image. This 6 parameter transformation (i.e. 3 XYZ translations and 3 rotations) is applied to the orientation header of the source NIfTI image, and also to the images provided in OtherList (optional).

Note that this SPM registration function uses a normalized mutual information (NMI) by default, enabling registration between two images with different contrast. Note that this algorithm will use the first volume of a multi-volume NIfTI

----
### xASL_spm_deface.m

#### Function
```matlab
function xASL_spm_deface(PathIn, bReplace)
```

#### Description
This function removes the face from an anatomical NIfTI image, e.g. T1w or FLAIR, for disidentification/privacy purposes. When this script is run after the ExploreASL structural module, it does a pretty good job even for 2D images.
However, note that this can always fail, strip part of the brain, or change the output of pipelines. So best not to compare results from defaced and non-defaced images.
Also, note that defacing makes it difficult to ensure that the FLAIR and T1w are from the same subject.

----
### xASL_spm_deformations.m

#### Function
```matlab
function xASL_spm_deformations(x, PathIn, PathOut, Interpolation, InverseSpace, AffineTrans, DeformationPath, VoxelSize)
```

#### Description

This allows to apply multiple transformations with a single interpolation, avoiding propagation of undesired interpolation effects. Mainly used to get native space images into standard space, or vice versa.
Best to combine as many files as possible within this function, since the deformation calculation (which is the most computation intensive part) needs to be performed once for multi-file resampling.

----
### xASL_stat_AtlasForStats.m

1. Load atlas ROI names. There should be a TSV sidecar to the atlas NIfTI file, as explained above.
2. deal with memory mapping
3. Resample atlas 50 1.5 mm^3 MNI
4. Converted atlas with integers to 4D binary image
5. Convert/compress masks into Columns
6. Print atlas overview image

```

#### Description
This function computes mean and spatial CoV for each ROI, in a \[1.5 1.5 1.5\] mm MNI space, with several ASL-specific adaptions:

1. Skip ROI masks that are smaller than 1 mL as this would be too noisy for ASL (skipped when x.S.IsASL==false)
2. Expand each ROI mask such that it has sufficient WM content (skipped when IsASL==false)
3. Create for each ROI mask a left, right and bilateral copy
4. Iterate over all subjects:
    * Load partial volume maps
    * Correct for WMH SEGM -> IS THIS STILL REQUIRED???
    * Load data
    * Show ROIs projected on ASL image
    * Actual data computations
        * Partial Volume Correction (PVC) options:
        * PVC==0 -> perform masking only, no regression
        * PVC==1 -> single compartment regression, for pGM
        * PVC==2 -> dual compartment regression for pGM & pWM (i.e. normal PVC)
        * Here we mask out susceptibility artifacts (including outside FoV) for all ASL computations, and also mask out vascular artifacts for computing the mean.
    * While other artifacts/FoV can be masked out on population level (i.e. >0.95 subjects need to have a valid signal in a certain voxel), vascular artifacts differ too much in their location between subjects, so we mask this on subject-level.

Note that the words "mask" and "ROI" are used interchangeably throughout this function, where they can have a different or the same meaning

**PM:** WE COULD CHANGE THIS, INTO MASK BEING USED TO EXCLUDE VOXELS AND ROI FOR INCLUDING VOXELS
