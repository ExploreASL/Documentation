# ExploreASL

## Description

**ExploreASL** is a pipeline and toolbox for image processing and statistics of arterial spin labeling perfusion **MR** images. It is designed as a **multi-OS**, open source, collaborative framework that facilitates cross-pollination between image processing method developers and clinical investigators.

The software provides a complete head-to-tail approach that runs fully automatically, encompassing all necessary tasks from data import and structural segmentation, registration and normalization, up to **CBF** quantification. In addition, the software package includes and quality control (**QC**) procedures and region-of-interest (**ROI**) as well as voxel-wise analysis on the extracted data. To-date, **ExploreASL** has been used for processing ~10000 **ASL** datasets from all major **MRI** vendors and **ASL** sequences, and a variety of patient populations, representing ~30 studies. The ultimate goal of **ExploreASL** is to combine data from multiple studies to identify disease related perfusion patterns that may prove crucial in using **ASL** as a diagnostic took and enhance our understanding of the interplay of perfusion and structural changes in neurodegenerative pathophysiology. 

Additionally, this (semi-)automatic pipeline allows us to minimize manual intervention, which increases the reproducibility of studies. 

## Highlighted Features

## Features

## Installation

To use **ExploreASL** within Matlab, you can download a stable release version from the GitHub releases section. Navigate within Matlab to the **ExporeASL** directory, to make **ExploreASL** the current working directory. It is recommended to use the Matlab **set paths** option to add the **ExploreASL** folder and all subfolders to the known paths. Execute the master script to start the interactive **ExploreASL** workflow:

```matlab
ExploreASL_Master
```
